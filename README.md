# ColorWellSample

Sample Code for implementing an NSColorWell object in a Glyphs.app plug-in

It installs itself as a menu item *Edit > My Colors.* When triggered, will bring up a Color Well.  Every time you pick a color, it will print its results to the Macro Window.

All you need to know is inside the `plugin.py` file. Look at the comments for further explanation.
